# WeatherDashboard

Hello! This weather dashboard utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide the user with the current day weather as well as the 5 day forecast for the city specified by the user. This project really helped me become comfortable with JQuery as well as navigating and indexing through JSON data. On top of that, I challenged my self to learn a new CSS framework while doing this project so i chose Bulma!
